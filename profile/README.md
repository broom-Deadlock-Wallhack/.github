# Deadlock Wallhack – Total Map Awareness, Zero Ambushes 🎯👀

## See First. Shoot First. Win Every Time.

In *Deadlock*, matches are fast, vertical, and filled with ability spam and flanking chaos. If you’re tired of getting jumped from behind or losing duels to players you never saw coming, a **Deadlock Wallhack** is exactly what you need 💥

Also known as **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, this cheat gives you full battlefield awareness — through walls, cover, buildings, and terrain. You’ll know where every enemy is, how much HP they’ve got, and when to strike with perfect timing.

## 🎮 What Is Deadlock?

Valve’s *Deadlock* is a third-person hero shooter mixing fantasy powers with guns, zip-rails, and tower-lane chaos. Think Overwatch’s roster, Valorant’s gunplay, and Dota-style strategy — all in one sweaty arena.

Skill matters… but **sight wins fights**. Wallhack = pure tactical domination.
